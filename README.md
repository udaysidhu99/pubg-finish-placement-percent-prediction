# PUBG Finish Place Percent Prediction

## About the Game

PlауеrUnknоwn’ѕ Battlegrounds, bеttеr knоwn аѕ PUBG, іѕ a multірlауеr battle rоуаlе gаmе іn whісh players drop оntо аn іѕlаnd and fіght tо bе thе last оnе lеft standing amongst a maximum of 100 opponents. Players are dropped via parachute on an island where they have to gather supplies and compete to be the last one standing. There is a 'zone' that shrinks with time. Players who fail to make it to this zone in time are eliminated automatically. There are various types of weapons that players can aquire that are randomly appear throughout the map. The most rare and effective items are dropped via supply crates which the players can open. There are multiple maps that the players can choose to play on. Players can also choose to team up with friends or random teamates in groups of two(duo) or four(squad). The dataset at hand contains metrics of various players which we will use to train machine learning models and try to predict the win percentage of that player where 1 would stand for 1st place and 0 for last place.
